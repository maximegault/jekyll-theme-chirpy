Here we consider that we have two hosts, `host_1` and `host_2`.

### Access to a variable defined in a job template

Additional variables defined in the job template:

```yaml
---
runtime_var: "Hi I'm a runtime variable from a job template"
# This is used to be access dynamically to a variable that belongs to a unique host
host_1:
  message: "FOO"
host_2:
  message: "BAR"
```

Access to these variables through the playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: "Dummy playbook"
  # ...
  tasks:      
    - name: Display runtime variable
      debug:
        msg: '{{ runtime_var }}'
    - name: Display specific dynamic host variable from job template
      debug:
        msg: "My message {{ vars[ansible_hostname].message }}"
```

### Access to a variable defined in a host

Host variable:

```yaml
---
host_var: "BAZ"
```

Access to this variable through the playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: "Dummy playbook"
  # ...
  tasks:      
    - name: Display host variable
      debug:
        msg: "Defined with the host: {{ hostvars[inventory_hostname].host_var }}"
```

### Access to a variable defined in a inventory

Inventory variable:

```yaml
---
inventory_var: "BOO"
```

Access to this variable through the playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: "Dummy playbook"
  # ...
  tasks:      
    - name: Display inventory variable
      debug:
        msg: "Defined with the inventory: {{ inventory_var }}"
```

### Access to a variables file through vars_files

AWX copies the playbook files into its own structure, so a relative path must be used:

```yaml
---
vars_files: ./vars/myFile.yml
```

### Pad left an int with leading zeros

With two variables, one string and one int:

```yaml
var_int: 4
var_string: "5"
```

Two leading zeros examples with [format](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.9.x/templates/#format) template:

```yaml
- name: Pads left an int value
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    final_var_1: "{{ '%02d' | format(var_int) }}"
    # Here we first cast the var_string into an int in order to add the two variables
    final_var_2: "{{ '%02d' | format(var_string | int + var_int) }}"
```

Final values:

```text
final_var_1 = "04"
final_var_2 = "09"
```
