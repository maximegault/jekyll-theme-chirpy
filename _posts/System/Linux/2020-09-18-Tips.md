### Create a symlink
```shell
ln -s ~/foo/bar/baz ~/mySymLink
```
### Print Working Directory a.k.a. pwd
When you've followed a symlink, pwd shows by default the logical path, ie:
```shell
cd ~/mySymLink
pwd
```
```
~/mySymLink
```
If you need the real physical path, use the -P argument:
```shell
pwd -P
```
```
~/foo/bar/baz
```
### Environment variables
List them:
```shell
printenv 
```
Add one:
```shell
export MY_VAR 
```
Remove one:
```shell
unset MY_VAR 
```
### Read a password from the console and avoid to have it in the bash_history
Example setting a proxy in an environment variable:
```shell
read -s pass
export my_var="http://user:$pass@my_proxy.com:1234"
```
### Remove a line in a file with a regex and sed
`-i` for in-place editing, `d` deletes the line if it matches
```shell
sed -i '/^regexPattern/d' myFile
```
