### Clone using a GitLab token
```shell
git clone https://myToken@myGitServer/myRepo.git
```

### Create a remote branch
Simply create a new branch and push it:
```shell
git checkout -b newBranch
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### Great .gitignore base for Visual Studio
[Great file to start with](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore)

### Certificate problem
The following error can occur: `SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`. It can happen when it's not the Windows certificate store that is used.
Check the `http.sslBackend` value in the config. If `openssl` is set, this is not good (it means that the openssl bundle certificate strop is used). It's better to have the `schannel` set:
```shell
http.sslbackend=schannel
```
Details on this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48212753/7445285). Note that it's not possible from WSL.

See [gloal .gitconfig documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) for more elements.
